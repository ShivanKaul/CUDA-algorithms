### Lab 3

To `make` everything, simply run `make` (the default target is all). For ease of testing you can also run `everything.sh` which will make and run everything and populate the `results/` folder with the images and output of grids. The `everything.sh` script takes in two arguments, and can be used as follows - 

```
chmod +x everything.sh
./everything.sh <YOUR NAME (to prepend to output images)> <NUMBER OF ITERATIONS TO RUN FOR LAB 2>
```
